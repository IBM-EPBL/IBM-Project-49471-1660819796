Abstract
India is agriculture sector, on either side, is losing ground every day, affecting the ecosystem's output capacity. In order to restore vitality and put agriculture back on a path of higher growth, there is a growing need to resolve the issue. A large-scale agricultural system necessitates a great deal of upkeep, knowledge, and oversight. The IoT is a network of interconnected devices that can transmit and receive data over the internet and carry out tasks without human involvement. Agriculture provides a wealth of data analysis parameters, resulting in increased crop yields. The use of IoT devices in smart farming aids in the modernization of information and communication. For better crop growth moisture, mineral, light and other factors can be assumed. This research looks into a few of these characteristics for data analysis with the goal of assisting users in making better agricultural decisions using IoT. The technique is intended to help farmers increase their agricultural output.

Introduction
I. INTRODUCTION

The India is an agricultural country.  Nowadays, at regular intervals the lands are manually irrigated by the farmers. There is a chance that the water consumption will be higher or that the time it takes for the water to reach the destination will be longer, resulting in crop dryness. Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring is crucial in many agricultural disciplines. However, the old method of wired detection control is inflexible, resulting in several application limitations. This project achieves irrigation automation as a crucial answer to this problem. This is accomplished with the aid of a Raspberry Pi, which controls the moisture and temperature sensors based on the input provided. Moisture sensors are used in the construction of an automated plant watering system for this purpose. The main aim of our project is to reduce the complexity of supervision and to avoid the continuous monitoring. We can accomplish smart agriculture using our system. This system includes IoT-based agricultural monitoring. The Internet of Things (IOT) is transforming the agriculture business and addressing the enormous difficulties and huge obstacles that farmers confront today in the field. The soil moisture sensor is put into the soil to determine whether the soil is wet or dry, and If the moisture level in the soil is low, the relay unit attached to the motor switch must be monitored on a regular basis. When the soil is dry, it will turn on the motor, and when the soil is moist, it will turn off the engine.

Zuraida Muhammad, Muhammad Azri Asyraf Mohd Hafez, Nor Adni MatLeh, Zakiah Mohd Yusoff , Shabinar Abd Hamid    The term "Internet of Things" refers to the connection of objects, equipment, vehicles, and other electronic devices to a network for the purpose of data exchange (IoT). The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly being utilised to connect objects and collect data. As a result, the Internet of Things' use in agriculture is crucial. The idea behind the project is to create a smart agriculture system that is connected to the internet of things. The technology is combined with an irrigation system to deal with Malaysia's variable weather. This system's microcontroller is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The temperature and humidity in the surrounding region, as well as the moisture level of the soil, are monitored using the DHT22 and soil moisture sensor. The data will be available on both a smartphone and a computer.  As a result, Internet of Things (IoT) and Raspberry Pi-based Smart Agriculture Systems have a significant impact on how farmers work. It will have a good impact on agricultural productivity as well. In Malaysia, employing IoT-based irrigation systems saves roughly 24.44 percent per year when compared to traditional irrigation systems. This would save money on labour expenditures while also preventing water waste in daily needs.

Divya J., Divya M.,Janani V.   Agriculture is essential to India's economy and people's survival. The purpose of this project is to create an embedded-based soil monitoring and irrigation system that will reduce manual field monitoring and provide information via a mobile app. The method is intended to help farmers increase their agricultural output. A pH sensor, a temperature sensor, and a humidity sensor are among the tools used to examine the soil. Based on the findings, farmers may plant the best crop for the land. The sensor data is sent to the field manager through Wi-Fi, and the crop advice is created with the help of the mobile app. When the soil temperature is high, an automatic watering system is used. The crop image is gathered and forwarded to the field manager for pesticide advice.

H.G.C.R. Laksiri, H.A.C. Dharmagunawardhana, J.V. Wijayakulasooriya  Development of an effective loT-based smart irrigation system is also a crucial demand for farmers in the field of agriculture. This research develops a low-cost, weather-based smart watering system. To begin, an effective drip irrigation system must be devised that can automatically regulate water flow to plants based on soil moisture levels. Then, to make this water-saving irrigation system even more efficient, an IoT-based communication feature is added, allowing a remote user to monitor soil moisture conditions and manually adjust water flow. The system also includes temperature, humidity, and rain drop sensors, which have been updated to allow remote monitoring of these parameters through the internet. In real time, these field weather variables are stored in a remote database. Finally, based on the present weather conditions, a weather prediction algorithm is employed to manage water distribution. Farmers would be able to irrigate their crops more efficiently with the proposed smart irrigation system.

Anushree Math, Layak Ali, Pruthviraj U  India is a country where agriculture plays a vital role. As a result, it's critical to water the plants wisely in order to maximise yield per unit space and so achieve good output. Irrigation is the process of providing a certain amount of water to plants at a specific time. The purpose of this project is to water the plants on the National Institute of Technology Karnataka campus with a smart drip irrigation system. To do this, the open source platform is used as the system's fundamental controller. Various sensors have been employed to supply the current parameters of components that impact plant healthiness on a continual basis. By controlling a solenoid valve, water is provided to the plants at regular intervals depending on the information acquired from the RTC module. The webpage may be used to monitor and manage the complete irrigation system. This website contains a function that allows you to manually or automatically control plant watering. The health of the plants is monitored using a Raspberry Pi camera that gives live streaming to the webpage. The controller receives water flow data from the water flow sensor through a wireless network. The controller analyses this data to see if there are any leaks in the pipe. Forecasting the weather is also done to restrict the quantity of water given, making it more predictable and efficient.

Dweepayan Mishra, Arzeena Khan, Rajeev Tiwari,  Shuchi Upadhaye   Agriculture is a substantial source of revenue for Indians and has a huge impact on the Indian economy. Crop development is essential for enhanced yield and higher-quality delivery. As a result, crop beds with ideal conditions and appropriate moisture can have a big influence on output. Traditional irrigation systems, such as stream flows from one end to the other, are usually used. As a result of this delivery, the moisture levels in the fields can alter. A designed watering system can help to enhance the management of the water system. This research proposes a terrain-specific programmable water system that will save human work while simultaneously improving water efficiency and agricultural productivity. The setup is made up of an Arduino kit, a moisture sensor, and a Wi-Fi module. Data is acquired by connecting our experimental system to a cloud framework. After then, cloud services analyse the data and take the necessary actions.

R. Nageswara Rao,  B.Sridhar  Agrarian countries like India rely heavily on agriculture for their development. Agriculture has always been a roadblock to the country's development. Smart agriculture, which comprises modernising present agricultural systems, is the only answer to this challenge. As a result, the suggested strategy attempts to use automation and Internet of Things technologies to make agriculture smarter. Crop growth monitoring and selection, irrigation decision assistance, and other uses are possible thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). To modernise and boost crop yield, a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous irrigation IOT system has been proposed. This project's main purpose is to produce crops using the least amount of water possible. Most farmers waste a lot of time in the fields in order to focus on water available to plants at the appropriate time. Water management should be improved, and the system circuit's complexity should be minimised. Based on the data collected from the sensors, the suggested system determines the amount of water required. Two sensors detect the humidity and temperature of the soil, as well as the humidity, temperature, and length of sunshine each day, and send the data to the base station. Based on these characteristics, the recommended systems must calculate the irrigation water quantity. The key benefit of the system is the integration of Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing, which will reduce water fertiliser consumption while increasing crop yields and assisting in the evaluation of field weather conditions.
